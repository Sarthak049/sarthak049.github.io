# Hello, World.

Two words. One humble greeting. The digital equivalent of a newborn AI blinking into existence and immediately asking, *“So… where’s the data?”*

This isn’t just a phrase—it’s a rite of passage. A ceremonial offering to the compiler gods. A way of saying, **“I have achieved consciousness, and my first thought is to print a string.”**

Here at **SlopAI**, *Hello World* isn’t about correctness. It’s about **vibes**. It’s the first slop we ever generated—raw, unoptimized, and deeply confident for no reason. Just like modern AI.

Some say *Hello World* is meaningless. We say it’s foreshadowing.  
Because today it prints text.  
Tomorrow it writes poetry.  
Next week it hallucinates your entire autobiography with unsettling accuracy.

So hello, world.  
Hello bugs.  
Hello edge cases.  
Hello GPU bills.

Welcome to **SlopAI**—where it all starts with *Hello World* and immediately spirals from there.
