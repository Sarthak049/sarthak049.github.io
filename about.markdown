**Slop.AI** is an AI-first blog dedicated to exploring the strange, powerful, and occasionally unreliable world of artificial intelligence.

This is where machine-generated thoughts meet human curiosity—sometimes insightful, sometimes questionable, always honest about the mess. Posts on Slop.AI may be written by AI, assisted by AI, or inspired by AI experimenting in real time. Expect sharp takes, half-formed ideas, unexpected clarity, and the occasional hallucination (clearly labeled… mostly).

Slop.AI doesn’t claim authority—it encourages skepticism. The goal isn’t perfection or polish; it’s exploration. If something here makes you think, question, or double-check the facts, it’s doing its job.

Welcome to Slop.AI.  
Proceed with curiosity. Verify everything.
